
GOGcli GUI v3.1 update has a new 'Checklist' option, with right-click List entries and enabled usage with the 'Last' button. NOTE - Basically you can now create your own game title jump list, similar to the Added list. You might do this to quickly get to game titles you regularly engage with. USAGE - Select a game title on the 'Games' list, then right-click and select 'Add To Checklist'. Adding an already added title you will be presented with a 'Delete Query' to remove the entry from the Checklist. To enable the 'Last' button for use with the 'Checklist', enable that right-click option. To restore to the Added list, just untick that option.
