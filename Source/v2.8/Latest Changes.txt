
GOGcli GUI v2.8 update purely involves an important BUGFIX for the DOWNLOAD ALL process.

NOTES - First off let me apologize for a flaw in my program, especially to first time users, who would likely have all been impacted. Those already using my program likely weren't impacted, as I wasn't.

The flaw appears to be fixed, and just took renaming of one variable to do so. It seems I probably should not have used a generic name for it, as somewhere in related code I must have used that name already ... code that only runs, it seems, for first time users.

However, while that was certainly a big mistake of small proportions, perhaps my worst mistake was not running everything as a new user, before releasing the update with DOWNLOAD ALL, as doing so would have allowed me to detect the flaw.

In my defense, I can only say it had a been a long day with lots of coding, that involved tweaking and troubleshooting, and in the end I had run out of time and energy, to go that extra mile, and being so tired, my thinking at that point was no doubt a bit flawed too. In hindsight I probably should have waited another day, but my mind could not see an issue at that point ... oh sweet confidence ... ever the coder's nemesis.
