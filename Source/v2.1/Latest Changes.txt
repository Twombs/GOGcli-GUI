Latest v2.1 update includes improvements & bugfix.

Discovered the CHANGELOG button in the DETAILS window wasn't working, so corrected that.
The ALL button in the DETAILS window can now save an 'Everything.txt' file to the program, Game or Games folder etc. This includes a new program sub-folder called 'Details'.
The 'Unicode Replacements' edit field in the DETAILS window, which was never implemented for use, has now been removed (will no longer be needed).
The 'Santitize' (purge) option in the DETAILS window, has now been improved to include a proper unicode text converter. It now also strips out any HTML from the text.
Other minor changes.
