
Latest v2.5 update includes a 'Continue Query' for 9 seconds between each file being validated with the 'Validate Game' option. Added new right-click menu entries for the 'Games' list. The 'Downloads' menu has three new entries - 'Excluded File Types', 'History Viewer' and 'Open the History file'. The 'Excluded File Types' entry has further entries for file type extensions, which can be set to be skipped from appearing in the 'Game Files Selector' Window. The 'History' entry runs a viewer for the new 'History.log' file that will have been created on first use of this update. The 'History.log' file is also updated when downloading game files. NOTE - If your current 'Log.txt' file already contains download records, then they will be extracted, to populate the 'History.log' file when this update first runs. In which case a splash titled 'Creating History!' will show until complete. Bugfix for wrong filename variable used for zip files during validation after downloading. Now showing what game title is selected for the 'Validate Now' option query. Several more improvements have been done to validating options and dialogs. Bugfix for row numbers on 'Game Files Selector' window after using right-click entry removal options.
