Ambitious new feature update.

Started work on an 'Exists' database. WORK IN PROGRESS

This involves a new enabling option on the SETUP window, and new sub-option.
And another right-click menu option on the ADD TO MANIFEST button.
One or more game titles can be processed ... individual or full list (from specified starting point). You browse to an individual game folder (with files) (COMPLETED), or select the main game folder of game title sub-folders (INCOMPLETE).

Downloaded files that pass validation, are added to the new 'Exists' database.

Validating a File or Game can add to the new 'Exists' database, dependent on success or a query.

The 'Games' list has a new right-click sub-menu 'Database' with two entries (Relax and View). The 'Relax' option mirrors the SETUP window one ... change one and the other is also changed.

The 'Game Files Selector' window now has a 'Relax' option, tied to that SETUp window (etc) option, but unlike them, is not a permanent change to the setting ... temporary only while the 'Selector' window remains open. This 'Relax' option if changed, reloads the files on the 'Selector' window.

What now shows on the 'Game Files Selector' window for downloading, is dependent on the new 'Enable' and 'Relax' options, and on what exists in the new 'Exists' database.

The FIND button process on the main window, now stores the last search text. To recall that search text for usage, the Title input field needs to be empty (before clicking the FIND button). It takes a second click to then do the search using that returned text.
