Ambitious new feature update.

Started work on an 'Exists' database. WORK IN PROGRESS

This involves a new enabling option on the SETUP window, and new sub-option.
And another right-click menu option on the ADD TO MANIFEST button. This changes the button to ADD TO DATABASE, which enables add to database browsing etc.
One or more game titles can be processed ... individual or full list (from specified starting point). You browse to an individual game folder (with files) (COMPLETED), or select the main game folder of game title sub-folders (INCOMPLETE).

A 'Warning Alert & Advice' dialog prompt enabled for game titles added to the database, that contain a keyword (chapter, episode, part, volume) that could indicate a multi game folder title.

Downloaded files that pass validation, are added to the new 'Exists' database.

Validating a File or Game can add to the new 'Exists' database, dependent on success or a query.

The 'Games' list has a new right-click sub-menu 'Database' with two entries (Relax and View). The 'Relax' option mirrors the SETUP window one ... change one and the other is also changed.

The 'Game Files Selector' window now has a 'Relax' option, tied to that SETUP window (etc) option, but unlike them, is not a permanent change to the setting ... temporary only while the 'Selector' window remains open. This 'Relax' option if changed, reloads the files on the 'Selector' window.

What now shows on the 'Game Files Selector' window for downloading, is dependent on the new 'Enable' and 'Relax' options, and on what exists in the new 'Exists' database.

The '(Loading List)' splash now displays 'Checking Database' instead of 'Checking FIle Names'. This hopefully makes things a bit clearer. NOTE - If the download list on the 'Game Files Selector' window, is not being populated or displays fewer items than expected, then checking the Log file should explain why. Generally though, if a file has been downloaded before for a game, and no change (update) has been detected, then the file is skipped for downloading. If you want to re-download the same file, then a setting on the SETUP window needs to be disabled to allow this (the 'Enable the exists database for usage' option).

The program can now download the Changelog and Description for a game. This can occur during the game files download process, or manually via the DETAILS button options. See the SETUP window for the two new options.

The DETAILS button now presents a 'Game Details' window, with some new & old (General) options. The new options allow viewing and or saving a Changelog.txt and Description.txt file, as well as viewing everything (ALL) about the selected game. The GENERAL button displays the previous DETAILS data etc.

The download progress field now displays some text related to current process (cover, changelog and description file downloading).

NOTE - Because file names are dynamic to the download URL, the program was doing a double check just before downloading and where necessary amending the download list values. But now due to the additional database check (if enabled), the program needs to do the file name check earlier, before loading the download list of the 'Game Files Selector' window. User will be warned of an issue, or alerted to file name changes that will require a manifest update (entries replaced).

The FIND button process on the main window, now stores the last search text. To recall that search text for usage, the Title input field needs to be empty (before clicking the FIND button). It takes a second click to then do the search using that returned text.
