
(v1.1)
Added an option to get ID(s) based on a full or partial game title.

(v1.2)
Added a query to set the required Country Code, plus a hidden setting to prevent the ID query at startup (see the 'Settings.ini' file entry ... skip=1 prevents). Option via the 'Program Information' dialog, to open the program folder. Other minor improvements.

(v1.3)
Top list entry is now blank for a quick way to clear all fields when selected. If the URL field is empty and the GO button is clicked, an input query appears for using a GOG game web page URL to get the Game ID. NOTE - There is now an experimental option to create a manifest entry for a game (disabled by default, but enabled in the 'Settings.ini' file ... change create=4 to create=1). BUGFIX - The black image now displays for any game without a cover image.

(v1.4)
Bugfix for installer file values in manifest. Program uses gogcli.exe and Cookie.txt files if found, to get file names and checksums for manifest entry.

(v1.5)
Bugfix for unicode in Type for manifest. Controls disabled while ADDing. Extended use of gogcli.exe etc for Extras.

(v1.6)
Added a 'Program Settings' window, accessed via 'Program Information' dialog. Manifest file name is now based on the game 'slug' (i.e. 15_days_manifest.txt). Slug title is now added to the manifest. NOTE - These changes add support for an adaption to my 'GOGcli GUI' program for independent downloading.

(v1.7)
Bugfix for OS for additional installer files in the manifest, same for Language and file Title.

(v1.8)
Program window can now be minimized during ADD, and DOS like Console windows can be hidden or minimized during ADD. The 'Settings.ini' file has been renamed to 'Options.ini', primarily so that the program can also work in the 'GOGcli GUI' folder, if you wish (NOTE - prior users will need to manually rename the 'Settings.ini' file). A 'Manifests' folder for created manifests is now created at startup if missing. Other minor improvements. Created manifest file can now be shown after ADD using either Notepad or a specified editor.

(v1.9)
Bugfix for bytes in the manifest, with the gogcli.exe query value taking priority. Added a 'Replace' button for game images (Boxart & Cover), so that corrupted downloads can more easily be replaced.

(v2.0)
Added an 'On Top' button for main program window. Extended window minimize and disabling of controls to the 'GO' and 'Get Game ID' button processes. If a GOG URL exists on the clipboard, it is now automatically copied to the floating input box field. The input box has been widened. Bugfix for bytes for Extras in manifest. Etc.

(v2.1)
Added a remove checkbox, that enables the ADD button as a CUT button, to remove a listed game and all related files. Added writing to a Log file (Info.log). Each file download URL is now echoed to the console window during manifest creation.

(v2.2)
Added a right-click list option to view the manifest for selected game entry, if it exists. Errors for download file data, during manifest creation, are now reported and logged. Existing manifest file for a game, is now queried about replacement, with the option of a backup occurring.

(v2.3)
Added another right-click list option to Open the selected game's data folder, if it exists. Game image files and detail text file have been relocated for all games, to ID named sub-folders. NOTE - Prior users will see a splash appear at program startup, which advises of the Data folder structure change (creating ID sub-folders and relocating game files to them).
