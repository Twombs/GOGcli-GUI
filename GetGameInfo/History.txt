
(v1.1)
Added an option to get ID(s) based on a full or partial game title.

(v1.2)
Added a query to set the required Country Code, plus a hidden setting to prevent the ID query at startup (see the 'Settings.ini' file entry ... skip=1 prevents). Option via the 'Program Information' dialog, to open the program folder. Other minor improvements.

(v1.3)
Top list entry is now blank for a quick way to clear all fields when selected. If the URL field is empty and the GO button is clicked, an input query appears for using a GOG game web page URL to get the Game ID. NOTE - There is now an experimental option to create a manifest entry for a game (disabled by default, but enabled in the 'Settings.ini' file ... change create=4 to create=1). BUGFIX - The black image now displays for any game without a cover image.
