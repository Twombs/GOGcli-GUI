Added a once off CDKey check to the 'Check & Fix The Manifest' right-click 'Games' list menu option process. This checks for CDKeys in you manifest, for entries you have added, prior to using this version (v1.7) of GOGcli GUI. You can only use the CDKey check once, without then needing to modify a value in the 'Settings.ini' file.

From v1.7 onward, CDKeys are detected during the adding or replacement of manifest entries, and stored in a 'CDkeys.ini' file.

The main GUI has had the 'GAME DETAILS' button shrunk to just 'DETAILS', and to its left is a new 'KEY' label and field.

If a game is noted as having a CDKey entry, the 'KEY' input field will show '1'.

To see the CDKey value, click the 'DETAILS' button. This shows you the key and allows copying it to the clipboard, or just continuing on with the previous 'Get Game Details from GOG' process.
