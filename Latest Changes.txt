
GOGcli GUI v3.0 update has two new fields and buttons on the DETAILS window, to allow viewing and copying either the selected Game ID or Game Web Page URL. The 'Game Files Selector' window now has three extra fields at the bottom of the list, to provide more information - File Title, Download URL, Game Title (NOTE - To see full text in these fields, the window will likely need to be stretched). BUGFIX for square brackets in a file name.
