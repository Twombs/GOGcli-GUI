
Finally remembered to remove the 'DOWNLOAD ALL is not yet fully supported!' from query text. Improved display options for main window and 'Game Files Selector' window, including providing a 'Keep Minimized' option on the latter window. BUGFIX for missing elements in DOWNLOAD ALL log (i.e due to an EXE file in Extras, without a checksum value). A fix also occurs at startup for incomplete entries in the 'Downall.log' file.

The 'LOG' option for DOWNLOAD ALL has been renamed to 'LOG Viewer', and a 'View LOG' option has been added to open it as a text file instead.

NOTE - Even though the 'Game Files Selector' window can now be set to minimized, you will likely see a momentary flash of it each time it would have appeared. Unfortunately I am yet to find a way around that.
