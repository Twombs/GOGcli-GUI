Tidying up some loose ends update.

Bugfix for row color when removing a Tag.

The 'Games' list right-click menu has undergone a slight revamp. This involves reducing what is first shown, by creating more sub menus and relocating some existing entries to them.

I've added an additional sub menu called 'Lists', that gives easier access to 5 files.
(1) Latest Additions - List of games added since you first populated the 'Games' list. These are the games you see when cycling with the LAST button.
(2) Games Updated - This is the list of games, that GOG indicate as being updated, that gets new additions (including remaining old) every time you use the 'CHECK or GET GAMES LIST' button.
(3) CDKeys - List of Games and their CDKeys (Serial, Code, Redeem Link, etc) in INI file format.
(4) DLCs - List of Games with DLCs in INI file format (no DLC specifics just a count).
(5) Tags - A list of games, if any, that you have tagged, in INI file format.

The 'SUB' button has been improved to include a 'create a Patches' sub-folder option & query.
