A backup regime has been implemented. Specific files are checked at program start, and if changed a numbered backup is created in a sub-folder called 'Backups'. Up to five backups are kept per file and cycled, with the oldest being replaced.

Added a 'Check & Fix The Manifest' right-click 'Games' list menu option. This checks the manifest for corruption and reports instances found.
