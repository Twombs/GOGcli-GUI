The compare process for 'COMPARE ALL GAMES' has had some improvements. Missing game folders can now be optionally ignored and skipped over, same for missing manifest entries, and both of those can optionally be (recorded) reported on. The 'Manifest Comparison Report' GUI (Report.exe) has been updated to support the new row colors and reporting.

The 'Games' list now has an additional right-click menu option for the Compare process, called 'Comparison Settings', which gives access to 8 comparison settings, and they control the compare process and reporting.

Updated the 'Language' key to now also be a 'Languages' key, to support 'gogcli.exe v0.10.0'.
